            "* **Rest up, superstar:** Your body needs energy to recover from the alcohol-processing marathon it just ran.  Think of sleep as hitting the \"reset\" button. 🛌\n",
            "* **Ginger power:**  Whether it's ginger tea, ginger ale, or even just nibbling on some candied ginger, this magic root can work wonders for nausea. \n",
            "* **Fresh air (if you can handle it):** A little oxygen can sometimes do wonders to clear the fog. If you're up for stepping outside, even for a few minutes, it might help. \n",
